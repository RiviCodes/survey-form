# Survey Form

[Live on GitHub Pages](https://rivicodes.github.io/survey-form/) using GitHub Pages.

_Basic survey page made from zero. This project's objective is to code a survey page aimed to aid a survey sent to customers. An attempt was made to create a (ugly) cup off coffee using only CSS. Results did not suffice, but helped me gain some experience on creating CSS shapes. Aside that, survey's HTML5 elements should work fine.

_Additional tweaking is needed if the survey needs to reach the backend._
